  <h3>Asynchrony: Now & Later</h3>

  <h4>A Program in Chunks</h4>
  <p>
    You may write your JS program in one .js file, but your program is almost certainly comprised of several chunks,
    only one of which is going to execute <i>now</i>, and the rest of which will execute <i>later</i>.
    The most common unit of each <i>chunk</i> is the function.<br />
    The <i>later</i> doesn't happen strictly and immediately after <i>now</i>. In other words, tasks that cannot complete
    <i>now</i> are, by definition, going to complete asynchronously, and thus we will not have blocking behavior as you
    might intuitively expect or want.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any time you wrap a portion of code into a function and specify that it should be executed in response to some event
    (timer, mouse click, Ajax response, etc.), you are creating a <i>later</i> chunk of your code, and thus introducing
    asynchrony to your program.
  </p>

  <h4>Event Loop</h4>
  <p>
    Up until recently (ES6), JavaScript itself has actually never had any direct notion of asynchrony build into it.
    The JS engine itself has never done anything more than execute a single chunk of your program at any given moment,
    when asked to.
  </p>
  <p>
    The JS engine doesn't eun in isolation. It runs inside a <i>hosting environment</i> (web browser, server, or other environment).
    All these environments have a mechanism in them that handles executing multiple chunks of your program <i>over time</i>,
    at each moment invoking the JS engine, called the <i>event loop</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In other words, the JS engine has had no innate sense of time, but has instead been an on-demand execution environment
    for any arbitrary snippet of JS. It's the surrounding environment that has always <i>scheduled</i> "events" (JS code executions).
  </p>
  <p>
    So, for example, when your JS program make an Ajax request to fetch some data from a server, you set up the response
    code in a function (commonly called a <i>callback</i>), and the JS engine tells the hosting environment, "Hey, I'm going
    to suspend execution for now, but whenever you finish with that network request, and you have some data, please call
    this function back".<br />
    The browser is then set up to listen for the response from the network, and when it has something to give you, it schedules
    the callback function to be executed by inserting it into the event loop.
  </p>
  <p>
    So what is the event loop?<br />
    Let's conceptualize it first through some fake-ish code: <br />
  </p>
  <pre>
    <code>
      // `eventLoop` is an array that acts as a queue (first-in, first-out)
      var eventLoop = [];
      ver event;

      // keep going forever
      while (true) {
        // perform a "tick"
        if (eventLoop.length > 0) {
          // get the next event in the queue
          event = eventLoop.shift();

          // now, execute the next event
          try {
            event()
          }
          catch (err) {
            reportError(err);
          }
        }
      }
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    This is, of course, vastly simplified pseudocode to illustrate the concepts. But it should be enough to help get a better understanding.
  </p>
  <p>
    As you can see, there's a continuously running loop represented by the while loop, and each iteration of this loop is called a <i>tick</i>.
    For each tick, if an event is waiting on queue, it's taken off and executed. These events are your function callbacks.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's important to note that <code>setTimeout(..)</code> doesn't put your callback on the event loop queue. What is does is set up a timer;
    when the timer expires, the environment places your callback into the event loop, such that some future tick will pick it up and execute it.
  </p>
  <p>
    What if there are already 20 items in the event loop at that moment? Your callback waits. It gets in line behind the others - there's not
    normally a path for preempting the queue and skipping ahead in line. This explains why <code>setTimeout(..)</code> timers may not fire
    with perfect temporal accuracy.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, in other words, your program is generally broken up onto lots of small chunks, which happen one after other in event loop queue.
    And technically, other events not related directly to your program can be interleaved within the queue as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    We mentioned "up until recently" in relation to ES6 changing the nature of where the event loop queue is managed.
    It's mostly a formal technicality, but ES6 now specifies exactly how the event loop works, which means technically
    it's within the purview of the JS engine, rather than just the hosting environment. One main reason of this change is
    the introduction of ES6 Promises, because they require the ability to have direct, fine-grained control over scheduling
    operations on the event loop queue.
